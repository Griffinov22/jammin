# Jammin'

Have you ever wanted to merge, update or create new playlists in Spotify? Well now you can with Jammin'! This React application was created to help me, Griffinov22, to get a better grasp of React while implimenting my previouis knowledge of REST API requests.

## Things I Found to be Difficult

I didn't understand what all the hub bub was about React and "prop drilling" that I had seen on social media. If I were to have to create this app again from scratch, I would have set up a context for "App" like I have seen many people do. Prop drilling really is the worst! It makes it harder to parse read the code. This does bring up a question...When passing props, do pass the exact name of the prop as the key and value?

Asyncronous functions in React are kind of a pain. After doing research, I have seen people make an asyncronous function inside of a useEffect, then immidiately calling it after the entire function declaration. This does work, but I think there is a better way to do this that I haven't seen yet. add-icon

## Things I Found to be Easier

Previous to starting this fun side-project I had only mainly used the hooks useState and useEffect. During this project I got to mess around with useRef and useContext. I feel that I understand all these hooks a lot more. I am starting to put together the exact times when useEffect is called and/or its clean-up function too.

While I am used to REST API calling, I explored much into the differnt headers that differnt APIs require. The Spotify API uses a header called "Authorization" which apparently is very common when I searched the web for how to do this correctly. The proccess of getting an access token from a user, then using that access token in an API request was very good practice for me.add-icon
